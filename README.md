### Word guessing game, written in JavaScript and beautifully designed in CSS
This is a word guessing game that I built.
<br>
You can play it here: [Word Guessing Game](https://rachit-pal.github.io/Word-guessing-game)
<br>
The game will give you a rando word to guess, and the player has to guess the letters in order to unscramble it. <br>
The game will tell you if your guessed letter is wrong, and also give you a hint about the word. <br>
Eg: A precious greyish-white metal » Silver
